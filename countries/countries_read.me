In this RAML specification:

We define a data type Country with the same properties as the MySQL table.
We create two resource endpoints: /countries for listing all countries and creating new ones, and /countries/{id} for retrieving, updating, and deleting a country by its ID.
Each resource endpoint has the corresponding CRUD operation (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
The request and response bodies are in JSON format and match the Country type defined in the RAML.
This RAML specification allows you to interact with the "countries" database table through a RESTful API, performing CRUD operations on the data. Please note that this is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you might want to add more error handling, validation, and other features as needed. Additionally, you would need to implement the backend logic to handle the API operations based on the RAML specification
