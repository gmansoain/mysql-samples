- Add an operation for Get Emperor by Name (more user-friendly than get emperor by id)
- Add responses for successful operations in PUT, DELETE, POST - i.e. emperor added successfully
- Parametrize the app.
    - Connection config for database based on env - dev/PROD
    - externalize these values so that we can modify properties by modifying only the external file
    - this external file will be used by Jenkins?

Define naming convention for:
- Flow names - format and what info should include, i.e. getEmperorById
- URL naming convention - should we include apiversion --> HTTP://<host_name>/api/v1/resource?
